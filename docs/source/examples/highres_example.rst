High-Resolution Color Image Deblurring
==========================================================

This tutorial walks through a complete example of the benchmark using the **High-Resolution Color Image** dataset. We will explore the dataset, configuration, and interpretation of results.


The Dataset: High-Resolution Color Image
-----------------------------------------

**What is it?**

The high-resolution color image dataset is a multi-operator inverse problem where the goal is to **recover a sharp color image from multiple blurred measurements**. Each measurement is the original image degraded by a different anisotropic (directional) Gaussian blur.

**Real-world analogy**: Imagine taking photos of the same scene through different blurred lenses. Each photo is degraded differently. The goal is to recover the original sharp image using information from all these blurred observations.

Configuration: Experiment Setup
-------------------------------

**Benchmark Purpose**

This is a **toy example** designed to test **distributed computing efficiency** on large-scale inverse problems. The high-resolution image (2048×1366) combined with forward operators (8 blurs) and a pretrained prior (DRUNet) creates computational demands that benefit from distributed processing across multiple GPUs. 

We use the configuration file ``configs/highres_imaging.yml`` to set up the experiment. The configuration specifies:

1. **Objective**: What metric to evaluate (PSNR, etc.)
2. **Dataset**: Which dataset to use and its parameters
3. **Solver**: Which solver to run and its hyperparameters
4. **Execution Grid**: Different GPU configurations to benchmark and compare

Execution Grid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The execution grid specifies different GPU configurations:

.. code-block:: yaml

   slurm_gres, slurm_ntasks_per_node, slurm_nodes, distribute_physics, distribute_denoiser, patch_size, overlap, max_batch_size: [
     ["gpu:1", 1, 1, false, false, 0, 0, 0],
     ["gpu:2", 2, 1, true, true, 448, 32, 0],
     ["gpu:4", 4, 1, true, true, 448, 32, 0],
     ]

**Important**: To ensure proper distributed parallelization, the number of tasks per node (``slurm_ntasks_per_node``) must equal the number of GPUs (``slurm_gres``). This ensures one process per GPU.

This creates a grid comparing three configurations:

**Configuration 1: Single GPU (baseline)**

.. code-block:: yaml

   ["gpu:1", 1, 1, false, false, 0, 0, 0]

- ``slurm_gres: gpu:1`` = 1 GPU
- ``slurm_ntasks_per_node: 1`` = 1 process per GPU
- ``distribute_physics: false`` = No parallelization of blur operators
- ``distribute_denoiser: false`` = Full image processed at once
- **Purpose**: Baseline performance on limited resources


**Configuration 2: 2-GPU with Distribution**

.. code-block:: yaml

   ["gpu:2", 2, 1, true, true, 448, 32, 0]

- ``slurm_gres: gpu:2`` = 2 GPUs
- ``slurm_ntasks_per_node: 2`` = 2 processes (one per GPU)
- ``distribute_physics: true`` = **Split 8 blur operators across 2 GPUs** (4 each)
- ``distribute_denoiser: true`` = **Spatial tiling**: Split large image into patches
- ``patch_size: 448`` = Each patch is 448×448 pixels
- ``overlap: 32`` = Overlap region for smooth transitions between patches
- **Purpose**: Multi-GPU scalability with operator and spatial distribution


**Configuration 3: 4-GPU with Increased Distribution**

.. code-block:: yaml

   ["gpu:4", 4, 1, true, true, 448, 32, 0]

- Similar to Config 2, but with 4 GPUs.
- **Purpose**: Further scalability test with more GPU resources

Dataset Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dataset section configures the high-resolution color image problem:

.. code-block:: yaml

   dataset:
     - highres_color_image:
         image_size: 2048          
         num_operators: 8           
         noise_level: 0.1        

**Parameter Meanings:**

- ``image_size``: The maximum dimension of the image. ``2048``: Large (tests scalability on GPUs)

- ``num_operators``: Number of different blur operators applied to create measurements. ``8`` : 8 measurements with different blur angles from 0° to 180°

- ``noise_level``: Gaussian noise added to the measurements (in pixel intensity 0-1 range). ``0.1`` : Realistic noise (10% noise)

Solver 
~~~~~~

The solver section configures the Plug-and-Play (PnP) reconstruction algorithm:

.. code-block:: yaml

   solver:
     - PnP:
         denoiser: drunet              
         denoiser_sigma: 0.005        
         step_size: 0.1                
         init_method: ["zeros"]       

**Solver Parameters:**

- ``denoiser``: The pretrained denoiser to use as a prior. 

- ``denoiser_sigma``: Noise level hint passed to the denoiser. Helps the denoiser adapt to the noise level.

- ``step_size``: Gradient descent step size. Controls convergence speed and stability.

- ``init_method``: How to initialize the reconstruction. 



Interpreting Results
--------------------

**Benchmark Results**

Below is an interactive dashboard comparing the three configurations:

Interpretation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**PSNR vs. Iteration & PSNR vs. Computation Time**

All setups reach about the same final PSNR, so using multiple GPUs does not reduce reconstruction quality. The multi-GPU runs reach the target PSNR much faster than the single-GPU baseline, which shows the speedup clearly.

**Time Breakdown: Gradient and Denoiser**

The denoiser dominates runtime and is the main bottleneck. Adding more GPUs reduces denoiser time, but gradient time stays almost the same since the gradient step is cheap, and communication between GPUs often takes longer than the computation itself.

**GPU Memory Usage: Gradient and Denoiser**

For multi-GPU configurations, the max memory shown corresponds to rank 0 (the main process), which is similar to other ranks. Interestingly, the 2-GPU setup uses more denoiser memory (4.3 GB) than a single GPU (1.6 GB), because peak memory for some denoisers is highly sensitive to image dimensions, even with small changes in input size. See the :doc:`takeaways page <../takeaways/gpu_memory_time_analysis>` for more details.
